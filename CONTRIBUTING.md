# Contributing
You will need your own copy of jorvik (aka fork) to work on the code. Clone the forked repository locally add your changes and create a Pull Request from the forked repo to jorvik.

- fork the repository
    Go to https://github.com/jorvik-io/jorvik and click the fork button. This will create a copy of jorvik in your Github account https://github.com/your-username/jorvik

- clone your fork in your machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jorvik.git
    ```
- add a reference to jorvik-io/jorvik to easily fetch updates
    ```bash
    git remote add jorvik https://github.com/jorvik-io/jorvik.git
    ```
- check your setup
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    You should expect to see 2 remote references origin that points to your account and jorvik that point to jorvik-io
